        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>
            While developing websites using <strong>Vue 3</strong>, I began to encounter the inconvenience of using modal windows. Some kind of
            a smart guy a couple of years ago suggested opening them directly, embedding components and displaying them using <strong>v-if</strong>.
            But how inconvenient it is and clutters up the components. For me personally, this was incredibly inconvenient and I decided to write
            something of its own. And then, a couple of years later, there was a transition from <em>Vue 2</em> to <em>Vue 3</em> and an active library appeared.

        <h2>Stored Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hello all, I would like to edit some data in a form within a modal. I'm using v-model for data binding. My problem is, when I change something in modal, the original data is being modified also. It should only be modified within modal and changed on save click. </li>
            <li>I wanted to disable the vertical scroll, but at the same time keeping the scrollbar, so that there's no weird shift when opening modal.</li>
            <li>I want to show the modal and disable scrolling, but at the same so that the scrollbar won't disappear, so that there's no weird shift</li>
            <li>I'm trying to make a modal for each element in a carousel that shows some info of the element but the problem is that it only renders when I but the modal component inside the component that is inside each slide. Also when the modal is rendering inside the carousel and not the whole page so it looks cropped. How do I make it so whenever I click on each element the main page grabs the info of the element I'm clicking and then render it in the main page?</li>
            <li>Hi guys! I hope you all are good. I wanna get help from you. I'm stuck trying to make a modal/popup to confirm leave page action from users. Can you have any idea how to do it? Thanks üëç</li>
            <li>Hi mates, I'm working on vue and bootstrap. I want to update a ref value - 'validated' by shown event handler of b-modal. But it doesn't work.
                In following code, I have added two console log to track the ref value. But at the moment of 'updatedValidateState' log, the ref value is false, even though 'validateResult' log is true.
                How can I solve it?</li>
            <li>I'm calling h-function to render a VNode for a modal window.
                What is the most straightforward way to insert this into my component?
                i'm using script-setup, and also was hoping that i could do this without modifying the template.</li>
            <li>I have a component that implements a table, where each row has a couple of actions; there is also a modal that can be opened for each row, that contains the same actions.
                What are the best practices for no duplicate action functions? Where should they be?</li>
            <li>Hi, im trying to create a modal where i can scroll, but the page itself should not scroll.
                Im using Nuxt 3 and Typescript.

                I use the following to disable the scrolling from the page, but how can i enable scrolling in the modal itself.?
                I tried to add different tailwind classes like overflow-y-auto and  overflow-scroll but they didnt make any difference.</li>
            <li>I have the following simple modal component, and now I am trying to add focus trapping to it through vueUse's useFocusTrap. However, it just doesn't work? Focus is not trapped within the target. Printing hasFocus in the modal is also always false</li>
